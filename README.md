# ðŸ”Š Speaker Classification and Transcript Viewer

This project provides a lightweight toolset for:
- Transcribing audio files with Whisper
- Classifying speakers using unsupervised clustering
- Browsing and renaming speaker labels in a GUI
- Viewing associated transcripts

## ðŸ—‚ Overview

### `transcript_generator.py`
Uses OpenAI's Whisper model to automatically generate transcripts for all audio files in a folder.

- **Input:** `.wav`, `.mp3`, `.m4a`, etc.
- **Output:** `.txt` transcript for each file
- **Model:** Whisper (default = `base`, changeable)

---

### `classify_wavs.py`
Clusters speaker embeddings using SpeechBrain and KMeans.

- **Input:** Directory of `.wav` files
- **Output:** A file (`speaker_labels.txt`) mapping each audio file to a predicted speaker label (`label_0`, `label_1`, ...)
- **Requires:** `speechbrain`, `torchaudio`, `sklearn`

---

### `label_audio_player.py`

Interactive GUI to:
- Browse audio by speaker label
- Listen to individual clips
- View transcripts
- Rename labels (saved persistently in `label_names.json`)

- **Dependencies:** `tkinter`, `pydub`, `simpleaudio`
- **Supports:** Playback + transcript sync
- **Extra:** Remembers your custom label names across sessions

# 3D Model Viewer
Tool used to convert nprim data to .obj & .mtl format as shown in:
[https://youtu.be/sdvsI-QBcZ0 https://youtu.be/sdvsI-QBcZ0](https://youtu.be/sdvsI-QBcZ0)

# Requirements
You will need to have a full version of **Urban Chaos** game to be able to use nprim_visualizer script. 


Textures can be exported by using tools from [https://github.com/Fire-Head/UCTxcTools/tree/master](https://github.com/Fire-Head/UCTxcTools/tree/master)

nprim_visualizer script has hardcoded path to textures at line 175:

            map_Kd = f"map_Kd C:/Games/Urban Chaos/server/textures/shared/prims/tex{key:03d}hi.tga\n"

You will need to change this path accordingly, as this is the path to textures used to do UV mapping. 
Additionally I copied all nprims (so I don't accidentally modify original) to res/nprims in the directory where python script is located. 

# Animations
These section contains all the tools that are related to characters animation in Urban Chaos. 
Keyframe extractor (shown in the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWrvUnAD1H8) is the baseline for this tools as it extracts each keyframe from the .all files. 
These can be extracted into separate .obj files or alternatively each keyframe can be calculated and rendered in real time in blender.
